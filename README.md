A playful web app that asks the all-important question: **"Do you love Akshat very much?"**  
But there's a twist — the **"No"** button runs away when you try to click it! 😄

## 🔧 How It Works

The app uses basic DOM manipulation with `mouseenter` events to move the "No" button around randomly inside the dialog box. It ensures the new position never overlaps with the "Yes" button.
